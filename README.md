### Project Description
Surgtwin is a web-based clinical learning and patient record system designed to help medical students and doctors digitally document patient vitals. It simulates a hospital-style electronic medical record, enabling users to maintain patient history across visits.

### The Problem statement
Medical errors during surgeries remain a serious global concern. According to reports from organizations like the World Health Organization, surgical complications and preventable mistakes contribute significantly to patient harm worldwide.

### The Solution
Our system works like a virtual surgical mentor. It gives structured, step-by-step procedural guidance, checks decision-making at every stage, and provides performance feedback — ensuring students are fully prepared before entering real operating theatres.
